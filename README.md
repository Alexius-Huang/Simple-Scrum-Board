# Simple Scrum Board

My first Angular App practice project.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.0.

Clone the project and then:

```
# Enter the project
$ cd simple-scrum-board

# Open development server
$ ng serve
```

Open another terminal and navigate to the project directory, and then open the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server):

```
$ json-server --watch db.json
```

Open your browser and navigate to `localhost:4200/`, there you go!
